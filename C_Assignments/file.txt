When you have a dream, you’ve got to grab it and never let go.
Nothing is impossible. The word itself says ‘I’m possible.
There is nothing impossible to they who will try.
The bad news is time flies. The good news is you’re the pilot.
If you make your internal life a priority, then everything else you need on the outside will be given to you and it will be extremely clear what the next step is.
Life has got all those twists and turns. You’ve got to hold on tight and off you go.
Keep your face always toward the sunshine, and shadows will fall behind you.
Success is not final, failure is not fatal: it is the courage to continue that counts.
Spread love everywhere you go.
Do not allow people to dim your shine because they are blinded. Tell them to put some sunglasses on.
